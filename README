Use cmake to build:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
	make
	./integral-eq

Output is written to a file in the working directory.
(It is a list of xy-pairs in the format usable in Mathematica's ListPlot command.)

There is no proper user interface as of now (sorry ...);
the algorithm has to be changed inside main.cpp and recompiled.
